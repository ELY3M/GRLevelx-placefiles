   Mesoscale Discussion 1651

   Areas affected...Northern Pennsylvania...New York and much of the
   New England states

   Concerning...Heavy snow 

   Valid 160306Z - 160900Z

   SUMMARY...Corridor of moderate to heavy snow with rates locally in
   excess of 1 inch per hour will continue developing northward through
   much of New York State into Vermont, New Hampshire and southern and
   central Maine through early morning. The snow will change over to a
   period of occasional freezing rain and drizzle from northeast
   Pennsylvania into a portion of southeast New York and southern New
   England with all rain across far southern New England.

   DISCUSSION...As of mid evening the corridor of moderate to heavy
   snow extends from the southern half of NY state eastward into a
   portion of southern and central New England. This activity is
   associated with a band of ascent within a deformation zone north and
   east of a progressive shortwave trough currently moving through the
   OH Valley. A surface low has deepened off the DelMarVa coast. As
   this feature continues northward, the zone of strongest
   frontogenetic forcing within the 800-700 mb layer will develop into
   eastern NY and much of the remainder of New England, contributing to
   increasing ascent within the dendritic growth zone. Moreover,
   mid-level lapse rates will gradually steepen from the south, and
   might eventually extend far enough northward for some convective
   enhancement to the snowfall rates. Farther south, WV imagery shows a
   mid-level dry-slot spreading eastward through PA and will eventually
   affect southern New England. The drying will extend low enough into
   the favored snow growth zone for precipitation type to change over
   to freezing drizzle with occasional heavier convective showers.
   Moreover, a substantial warm layer aloft will also evolve from the
   south as the surface low and southerly low level jet continues
   northward.
